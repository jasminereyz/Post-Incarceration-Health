# Post-Incarceration
AA191 Final

## Objectives
In the spirit of Sankofa, we want to show how women’s education is impacted by incarceration, and how continued higher education gives them the ability to come back to education. We hope to accomplish this in two ways:
- We will survey formerly-incarcerated non-males at CSULA on how their educational paths looked prior to incarceration and how their journeys have changed after joining Project Rebound. As education can be a predictor of the likelihood of incarceration, our survey wants to highlight the first-hand experiences of non-males impacted by the criminal justice system.
- We want to share the experiences of non-male, formerly incarcerated individuals empowered through this map by mapping their journey as more than just markers on a map. The markers will display the school they last attended and school grade prior to incarceration. It will also include their personal perspectives on education post-incarceration.

## Empowerment
Our project strives to empower the voices of non-male formerly incarcerated individuals. We know that education can be a predictor of the likelihood of incarceration and we want to bring awareness to just how important education can be. 

## What Technology Was Used & How It Can Be Repurposed





## Social Problem
The social problem that we are addressing is mass incarceration, which is often referred to as the "new Jim Crow" and is notoriously seeped in corruption sown from the for-profit prison industrial complex. Because of these circumstances, we hope to empower the voices of previously incarcerated individuals. Although we had some ideas of which issues we could address, we would like to speak directly with community members to guide the direction we take this project. So far, we have contacted two non-profits called Friends of Los Angeles (FOLA) and Fa'atasiga o Uso; we intend to reach out to additional organizations such as the Prisoner Reentry Network, Project Rebound, and Root & Rebound.

## Potential Problems
### Technical 
Unfortunately, with the few weeks that we have to complete this project, we need to be realistic about what can feasibly be accomplished in this timeline. Although we may have grandiose ideas, at the end of this class, we want a finished product, and that will only come to fruition if we create project ideas that balance matching our technical breadth and meeting the needs of our community.

### Ethical
We hope to not performatively utilize the voices of the formerly incarcerated, only perpetuating oppression and marginalization, but to truly provide a platform to uplift their voices. Our job is not to save these people or to find a solution for them—but it is to use our tools to allow the community to empower themselves. Let's not forget that; we just learned this.
