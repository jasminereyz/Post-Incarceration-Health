AA191 Final!!

## Table of Contents 


## General Information 
Sankofa - “It is not taboo to go back for what you forgot (or left behind)”

In the spirit of Sankofa, we want to show how women’s education is impacted by incarceration, and how continued higher education gives them the ability to always come back to education. We hope to accomplish this in two ways, one being:
- We will survey formerly-incarcerated non-males at the California State University-Los Angeles on how their educational paths looked prior to incarceration and how their journeys have changed after joining Project Rebound. As education can be a predictor of the likelihood of incarceration, our survey wants to highlight the first-hand experiences of non-males impacted by the criminal justice system.

- We want to share the experiences of non-male, formerly incarcerated individuals empowered through this map by mapping their journey as more than just markers on a map. The markers will display the school they last attended and school grade prior to incarceration. It will also include their personal perspectives on education post-incarceration. 

## Who Is Being Empowered?
- We hope that our project provides a safe space for the formerly incarcerated women at Cal State LA to express their feelings on education and the injustices they might face. By using an anonymous Google Form survey, we are getting firsthand direct experiences and emotions without fear of judgement or being silenced.

## Project Staus 
In Progress !

## Room for Improvement 
Survey Based


To-Do:
- Due to an overwhelming support, we got interest from other non-male individuals from different schools and because our survey was only tailored to CSULA we could not take their responses and by no means do we want to exclude other voices that need to be empowered. Thus, we would look into expanding our project to the rest of the CSU and eventually the UC sytems.

- Add engaging buttons!

## Social Problem
The social problem that we are addressing is mass incarceration, which is often referred to as the "new Jim Crow" and is notoriously seeped in corruption sown from the for-profit prison industrial complex. Because of these circumstances, we hope to empower the voices of previously incarcerated individuals. Although we had some ideas of which issues we could address, we would like to speak directly with community members to guide the direction we take this project. So far, we have contacted two non-profits called Friends of Los Angeles (FOLA) and Fa'atasiga o Uso; we intend to reach out to additional organizations such as the Prisoner Reentry Network, Project Rebound, and Root & Rebound.
